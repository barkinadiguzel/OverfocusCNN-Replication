# OverfocusCNN-Replication
OverfocusCNN aims to prevent convolutional neural networks from over-relying on small, highly salient regions of input images by applying saliency-guided dropout. This encourages the model to distribute its attention more evenly, improving generalization across diverse visual tasks.
